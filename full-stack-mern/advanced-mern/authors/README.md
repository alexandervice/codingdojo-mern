# Authors
This is a full stack MERN (mongoose, express, react, node) web app that allows for a user to create, read, update, and delete Favorite Authors in the database.

This is also my first attempt at using tailwind in a react project

## Installation
```bash
npm install
```
navigate to the server folder (install nodemon first)
```bash
nodemon server.js
```
navigate to the client folder
```bash
npm start
```
