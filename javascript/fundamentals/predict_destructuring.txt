problem 1)

	console.log(randomcar) - 'Tesla'
	console.log(otherRandomCar) - 'Mercedes'

problem 2)

	console.log(name) - this is a syntax error, there is no variable called name
	console.log(othername) - 'Elon'

problem 3)

	console.log(password) - 12345 (this is because we had already declared password prior to the next line)
	console.log(hashedPassword) - syntax error, there is no variable in person called password for us to call on

problem 4)

	first = 2
	second = 5
	third = 2

	console.log(first == second) - false (2 does not equal 5)
	console.log(first == third) - true (2 equals 2)

problem 5)

	console.log(key) - 'value'
	console.log(secondKey) - [1,5,1,8,3,3]
	console.log(secondKey[0]) - 1
	console.log(willThisWork) - 5
