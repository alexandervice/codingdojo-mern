When using React, we will want to include the following script links (for now)
    <script crossorigin="" src="https://unpkg.com/react@16/umd/react.development.js"></script>
    <script crossorigin="" src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@16/umd/react-dom.development.js"></script>

Example of making an h1 with react:
    const myReactComponent = React.createElement("h1", {}, "I am creating my first React component")

Example of a nested react component:
    const myNestedReactComponent = React.createElement("div", {}, React.createElement("p", {}, "This element is nested"))
